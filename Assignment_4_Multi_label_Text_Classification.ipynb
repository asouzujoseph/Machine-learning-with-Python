Function and variable names should be well-chosen to convey what they do or represent. Functions should have docstrings explaining what they do. Comments should be used to explain the details of what you are doing, to help your evaluator follow along. "

Try your best without these restrictions, but know that you have this option as a backup plan, if you are truly running out of time.\n",
